## Usage

This is a java project management program that will store all the important information of a defined project, from customer detail, customer detail and architect details to what the project is going to cost and what amount has already being payed. All the details can be edited and new details can be added to the project. After the project is done, the program will then save all the details to a text folder named 'completedProject.txt', generate a invoice, the amount the customer still owes the company.
